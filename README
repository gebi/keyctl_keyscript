decrypt_keyctl
==============

A passphrase caching script to be used in /etc/crypttab on Debian and Ubuntu.
When there are multiple cryptsetup (either plain or LUKS) volumes with the same
passphrase, it is an unnecessary task to input the passphrase more than once.

Just add this script as keyscript to your /etc/crypttab and it will cache the
passphrase of all cryptab entries with the same identifier.

Either copy decrypt_keyctl into the default search path for keyscripts from
cryptsetup /lib/cryptdisks/scripts/. So you can just write keyscript=decrypt_keyctl
in /etc/crypttab, or use a random path of your choice and give the full path
e.g keyscript=/sbin/decrypt_keyctl.


Requirements
------------

    - Debian cryptsetup package with /etc/crypttab handling and keyscript option
        - Tested with Debian Lenny, Squeeze and Sid
    - Installed and working keyutils package (keyctl)
        - Needs CONFIG_KEYS=y in your kernel configuration


What For?
---------

The current state for dm-crypt in Linux is that it is single threaded, thus
every dm-crypt mapping only uses a single core for crypto operations.
To use the full power of your many-core processor it is thus necessary to split
the dm-crypt device. For Linux software raid arrays the easiest segmentation is to
just put the dm-crypt layer below the software raid layer.

But with a 5 disk raid5 it is a rather daunting task to input the passphrase five
times.
This is what this keyscripts solve for you.


Usage
-----

Best shown by example:
    - 5 disks
    - Linux software raid5

Layer:
      sda             sdb            sdc ... sde
    +-----------+   +-----------+
    | LUKS      |   | LUKS      |
    | +-------+ |   | +-------+ |
    | | RAID5 | |   | | RAID5 | |
    | | ...   | |   | | ...   | |

Crypttab Entries:

<target>    <source>    <keyfile>        <options>
sda_crypt   /dev/sda2   main_data_raid   luks,keyscript=decrypt_keyctl
sdb_crypt   /dev/sdb2   main_data_raid   luks,keyscript=decrypt_keyctl
...
sde_crypt   /dev/sde2   main_data_raid   luks,keyscript=decrypt_keyctl


How does it work
----------------

Crypttab Interface:
A keyscript is added to options including a keyfile definition as third
parameter in the crypttab file. The keyscript is called with the keyfile as the
first and only parameter. Additionally there are a few environment variables
set but currently are not used by this keyscript (man 5 crypttab for exact
description).

Keyscript:
Keyctl_keyscript uses the Linux kernel keyring facility to securly cache
passphrases between multiple invocations.
The keyfile parameter from cryptab is used to find the same passphrase between
multiple invocations.

Currently the cache timeout is 60 seconds and not configurable (please report a
bug if it is too low for you).


Problems
--------

    - Passphrase is piped between processes and could end up in unsecured
        memory, thus later swapped to disk!
        => Use of cryptoswap recommend!


Hints
-----

To remove all traces of this keyscript you may want to cleanup the keyring
completely with the following command afterwards:
    sudo keyctl clear @u
